Go recently turned eleven, so you can imagine how much the language and its ecosystem have evolved through the years. A strongly typed language, it’s become increasingly popular with its garbage collection and concurrency support. It’s massively performant, scalable, and resource-use efficient. Small wonder that Go is applied across a multitude of areas these days, including web applications, microservices, cloud computing, web servers, and other systems/tools.

In this article, we’ll look at blogs written by Go users, contributors, and educators about the various ways they are making use of the language.
